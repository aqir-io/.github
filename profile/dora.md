# Measuring Engineering Performance with DORA Metrics

At Aqir, we are committed to building high-performing software delivery and operations teams. To help quantify our progress, we have adopted the industry-standard DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics framework. 

The DORA metrics provide key insights into our development velocity, release reliability, and operational resilience. By tracking metrics like deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery, we can benchmark our teams against the broader software industry.

Regularly assessing our DORA metrics will enable us to:

- Evaluate the effectiveness of our engineering practices 

- Identify areas for improvement across our development lifecycle

- Quantify the impact of process or technology changes

- Set measurable goals for maturing our software delivery and operations 

- Motivate our teams by demonstrating progress over time

Our goal is to meet or exceed DORA's published metrics for high-performing organizations. This will give us objective evidence that our focus on DevOps, site reliability, and continuous delivery is paying dividends for Aqir. DORA gives us a framework to keep leveling up our engineering capabilities over time.
| **Metric** | **Description** |
|-|-|  
| Deployment Frequency | How often code is deployed to production environments. Healthy teams deploy multiple times per day/week. |
| Lead Time for Changes | The time between code commit and deployment to production. Short lead times indicate velocity and deployment automation. |
| Time to Restore Service | How fast services are recovered after an incident. Shorter times signal effective incident response. |   
| Change Failure Rate | Percentage of deployments causing incidents or rollbacks. Lower rates indicate higher quality practices. |
| Mean Time to Recovery | The average time between service outages or incidents. Shorter times suggest better mitigation of issues. |

These key metrics will be tracked over time and benchmarked against industry standards to measure the effectiveness of our software delivery and operational practices. Improvements across these dimensions will indicate healthier engineering teams and more robust services overall.
